# Data Structures & Algorithms

TODO:

- btree (and later general tree)
- graph + shortest path
  - all 3 implementations
- buffer
- linkedlist
    - with fast and slow ptr (cycle detection)
    - with reversals
- bisect
- DFS/BFS with a deque
- (monotonic-enforced) stack
- heap w/ topk problem example

patterns:
- prefix sum (failed w/ alex)
- two pointer (same as above)
- sliding window (same as above)
- flood fill
- greedy, backtracking (recursive and maybe iterative)
- DP stuff
- strings questions
